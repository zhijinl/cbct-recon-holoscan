In this folder you will find the main components you need to recreate our application holoscan of cbct reconstruction and see
the results on a local OHIF viewer.

First we have installed holohub and implemented this application in it.
https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holohub
We have made a new directory in the holohub/applications directory for our application and put everything that you can find with
this README in it.

If in the future you want to start this application like the others with the command
./run launch your_application_name python              (python is added if you have put this application in a directory named python)
You will need to follow the steps given by the holohub's documentation

You will also need to download the data used for testing this application, you will find the link in the data directory.
Install it and extract it directly in data, it shoud look like this:
Ldata/
 L dicom_templates/
 L train/
 L validate/

Build the orthanc docker and start it
docker run -p 8042:8042 -p 4242:4242 orthanc-image

Then start the OHIF viewer with this command (You may need to create an environment with an anterior version of python):
./start_monailabel


For the next part you can use the container in this git if needed
./build_image_pytorch.sh
./launch_container.sh

finally build then start your application, if you've installed as an application of holohub, you can start it with this command
holohub$ ./run build your_application_name
holohub$ ./run launch your_application_name python

You can then see your results in your browser at this address:
http://localhost:8000/ohif/

You can also have details of those studies in this orthanc address:
http://localhost:8042/app/explorer.html
